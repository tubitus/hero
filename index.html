                <h2>About The Witcher Saga</h2>
                <p>The Witcher saga began as a series of fantasy short stories and novels written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. 
                   The series follows Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter who struggles to find his place in a world where people 
                   often prove more wicked than beasts. The franchise has expanded into critically acclaimed video games by CD Projekt Red, 
                   with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt being hailed as one of the greatest games of all time, and a successful Netflix series 
                   starring Henry Cavill as Geralt.</p>
